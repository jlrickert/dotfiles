## Architecture

Project has a few core directories:

- **Project specific scripts:** Scripts located in `bin`. This is scripts intended for boot strapping and testing.
- **Reusable code:** Scripts in `lib` intended to be used as reusable code
- **Module directories:** This isolated things located in the `pkg` directory. Each should at least have the following
  - **Global binaries:** Will have exported scripts in a `bin` directory
  - **install.sh:** Installation script for the specific module. This should be idempotent
  - **env.sh:** This will be automatically sourced

### Modules

- **nvim:** My neovim setup
- **shell:** My current shell setup. This makes up the base of my setup
- **Docker:** TODO
- **go:** Golang things

## Installation testing
